  
DAY 1  
Today   
  
🔥 That’s the energy, Shifin.  
You start **today**, so I give you **exact instructions for TODAY only**. No overload. Just Day 1.  
  
## 🚀 DAY 1 PLAN (2 Hours)  
## 🎯 Goal Today:  
* Install tools  
* Write first structured Python class  
* Think like software engineer  
  
## 🛠 STEP 1 – Install Setup (30–45 mins)  
Install:  
1. Python (latest version)  
2. VS Code (editor)  
That’s all for today.  
No PyQt today. First build strong base.  
  
## 🧠 STEP 2 – Learn & Practice (1 Hour)  
Today study:  
* What is Class?  
* What is Object?  
* What is __init__?  
* What is attribute?  
* What is method?  
Then write this program:  
  
class Motor:  
    def __init__(self, name):  
        self.name = name  
        self.is_running = False  
  
    def start(self):  
        self.is_running = True  
        print(self.name, "is running")  
  
    def stop(self):  
        self.is_running = False  
        print(self.name, "is stopped")  
  
  
motor1 = Motor("Main Motor")  
motor1.start()  
motor1.stop()  
Understand every line.  
Don’t copy blindly. Understand.  
  
## 🧠 STEP 3 – Think Like Product Builder (15 mins)  
Now imagine:  
In future software:  
Motor = Class Contactor = Class Overload = Class PLC = Class  
Everything is object.  
That is why OOP is foundation.  
  
## 🎯 END OF DAY 1 CHECK  
Before sleeping, you must answer:  
✔ Can I create a class? ✔ Can I create an object? ✔ Can I call a method?  
If YES → Day 1 success.  
  
## ⚡ Important Rule  
From today: You are not just learning Python.  
You are building:  
Industrial PLC & Automation Validation Software  
This is long journey.  
But today? Just 2 hours.  
  
Come back after finishing Day 1.  
Tell me: “Day 1 completed.”  
And I will give Day 2 mission 🚀

Notes day 1   
  
  
What is the class   
class is the object blueprint   
  
And   
Types of methods   
1.   Def config(self):  
2.   Print is the output data  
  
                                                                                        ==Meaning of com1 computer 1==  
Next   
                                              
Types of users   
  
* “Class” is a users or which making name   
```
eg:- class computer:

```
* [ Def config(self): ]  this is the setting config’s.   
```
eg:-Def config(self):

```
* “Print“ is the this is data setting option   
```
eg:- print(“i5, 16gb, 1TrB”)

```
* Objects   
```
eg:- com1 =computer ()

```
```
 com2 =computer ()
 com3 =computer ()
 com4 =computer ()

```
* Choose the config data print or output  
```
  eg:- 
one
computer.config(com1)
computer.config(com2)
To two of models 
two
com1.config()
com2.config()

```
++But most using type option two++  
  
  
Next   
  
What is the __inti__   
  
* __inti__ is a special method in python classes   
* It is used to initialize object attribute   
* “__inti__“ is automatically called when you create an new insurance of a class  
* It enables you to set up object according to your specific requirements during the object creation
